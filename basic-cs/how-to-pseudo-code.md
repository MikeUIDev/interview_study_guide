# How to Pseudocode Efficiently?

Whether you are a junior or senior developer, 
knowing how to do successfully pseudo code will differentiate the good engineers from the bad engineers.
You may still find exceptions from time to time, 
or you may find people who just go straight into code without pseudo coding, 
either way is fine. There is no right or wrong ways when you code,
but if you are struggling with coding, 
I would try to improve psuedo coding skills first.

So I would like to go over some hints and tips about how to do pseudo code.

## Understand Pseudocode

### What is pseudocode?
Pseudocode are verbal outlines of the logic to your solution to a specific coding using English.
    ```javascript
        

    ```

### Steps
- Think over the questions 1 more time, ask yourself the following questions first:
    * What is the input of this program for? For example, am I dealing with array, strings or integer?
    * What is the output of this program for? For example, should I return false? a string? a number?
    * What are the test cases that I should use for this program? For example, when should I break my game logic and make it stop?

- Once you 

## Question Practice: 

* Pseudocode steps that you would take for making a coffee:
* Pseudocode steps that you would take for putting an elephant into a fridge.

* Pseudo code Two Sum:
```javascript
    Array.prototype.twoSum = function (target) {
     console.log("this: " + this);
     console.log("target: " + target);
   }
   console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].twoSum(6))
```
