# Software Design Pattern

- A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
- It develops templates/blueprint of codes that can be reusble in different situations (Passing different functions or pararmeters).
- Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
- Design patterns may be viewed as a `structured approach` to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.


## Object-Oriented Design Patterns
- Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. 
- State is mutatable.

## Functional Programming Design Patterns
Functional Programming Design Patterns imply immutable state.
