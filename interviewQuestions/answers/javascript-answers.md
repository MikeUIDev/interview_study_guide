### How would you empty the array?
- use slice, splice method
- use array.length = 0

### How do you clone an object?

### What is difference between `proto` vs `__proto__` ?

### Explain how prototypal inheritance works?
- JS Object inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.
- The prototype property is an object, and it has a constructor property by default which allows yo to add new properties and methods to existing objects types.
- __proto__ : when an object is created in JAvaScript, JavaScript Engine adds a __proto__ property to the newly created object; it points to the prototype object of the constructor function.

### How to merge two JavaScript Objects?
- Use Object.assign({}, obj)
- if using `merge`, remember to mention that you need to import from lodash.

### How to test whether a value is NaN?
- You can use `isNaN(value)` method to check to see if a value is NaN. 

### Explain event delegation
- Capturing and bubbling allow to implement one of most powerful event handling patterns called event delegation.
- The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them â€“ we put a single handler on their common ancestor.
- In the handler we get event.target, see where the event actually happened and handle it.

### Explain how `this` works in JavaScript?
- The value of `this` is determined by how a function is called. It CANNOT be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called.
- Has some difference between `strict` mode and `non-strict` mode.
