### How would you empty the array?
- Method 1: `array = []`
- Method 2: `array.length = 0`
- Method 3: `array.splice(0,array.length)`
- Method 4: `while (array.length > 0) { array.pop(); }`

### How do you clone an object?
```javascript
- var shallow_dup = Object.assign({}, obj); // shallow dup
- var deep_dup = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) // faster

### What is difference between `proto` vs `__proto__`?
**`Object.prototype.`**
- one
- two
- three

**`Object.prototype.__proto__`** 
- Points to the object which was used as prototype when the object was instantiated. 
- Its getter function exposes the value of the internal [[Prototype]] of an object
- Its setter allows [[Prototype]] of an object to be mutated. The object must be extensible accord to Object.isExtensible(): if it is not, a TypeError is thrown. The value provided must be an object or null. Providing any other value will do nothing.

```javascript
Object.prototype // Object created using object
Array.prototype // Object created using array

var fun = new Fun();
fun.prototype // Object created using Fun, fun is a function; this value is the value of fun.prototype
```

### Explain how prototypal inheritance works?
- *A prototype is a working object instance.*
- *Objects inherit directly from other objects.*
- Instances allows for easy selective inheritance and a flat [[Prototype]] delegation hierarchy. 
- Class taxonomies are not an automatic side-effect of prototypal OO.
- JS Object inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.
- The prototype property is an object, and it has a constructor property by default which allows yo to add new properties and methods to existing objects types.
- __proto__ : when an object is created in JAvaScript, JavaScript Engine adds a __proto__ property to the newly created object; it points to the prototype object of the constructor function.

### How to merge two JavaScript Objects?
- Use Object.assign({}, obj)
- if using `merge`, remember to mention that you need to import from lodash.

### Explain event delegation
- Capturing and bubbling allow to implement one of most powerful event handling patterns called event delegation.
- The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them â€“ we put a single handler on their common ancestor.
- In the handler we get event.target, see where the event actually happened and handle it.

### Explain how `this` works in JavaScript?
- The value of `this` is determined by how a function is called. It CANNOT be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called.
- Has some difference between `strict` mode and `non-strict` mode.

### What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?
- `AMD`: Asynchronous Module Definition - is another specification for modules. For example: ReS. It is generally more used in client-side(in-browser) JavaScript development due to this.

### Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`.
- `IIFE` - **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions**
- This roduces a lexical scope using JavaScript's function scoping. 
- This example doesn't work because it needs a wrapper.

IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads function foo(){ }(); as function foo(){ } and ();, where the former is a function declaration and the latter (a pair of brackets) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ).

Here are two ways to fix it that involves adding more brackets: (function foo(){ })() and (function foo(){ }()). These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.

### What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?
  - Proper way to make it IIFE is:
```javascript
(function foo(){ })();
```

### What is the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared?
- `null` - is primitive type; can be assigned to variable; has no value.
- `undefined` - variable is declared, but has yet to be assigned a value.
- `undeclared` - variable is not declared at all --> will return Reference error 
### How would you go about checking for any of these states?
- Although there are many approaches to check for these states. I would say the key thing is to be able to console.log the output at certain point in your code. The following offer several good ways: 
```javascript
var foo;
console.log(foo); // undefined
console.log(foo === undefined); // true
console.log(typeof foo === 'undefined'); // true
```
### What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
- Closure determines whether a function(inner) has access to certain variables in the outer one.
- Closure has access to variables in three scopes:
  - 1. variable of its own scope
  - 2. variables in the enclosing function's scope
  - 3. global variables
  ```javascript
  var globalVar = "xyz";

  (function outerFunc(outerArg) {
      var outerVar = 'a';
      
      (function innerFunc(innerArg) {
      var innerVar = 'b';
      
      console.log(
          "outerArg = " + outerArg + "\n" +
          "innerArg = " + innerArg + "\n" +
          "outerVar = " + outerVar + "\n" +
          "innerVar = " + innerVar + "\n" +
          "globalVar = " + globalVar);
      
      })(456);
  })(123);
  ```
  output is: 
  ```javascript
  outerArg = 123
  innerArg = 456
  outerVar = a
  innerVar = b
  globalVar = xyz
  ```

### Can you describe the main difference between a `forEach` loop and a `.map()` loop and why you would pick one versus the other?
- They are both iteration methods.
- `forEach` - modifies the original assignment. Original gets modified. You should use this method if space is a concern in your codes. Also note that in OOP programs, state is shared so if you do modified the original, other function that depends on the same variable will also get affected.
- `map()` - duplicate the original and create a new variable. Original will not be modified. 

### What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
** Check the answers one more time **
- Generally speak, an anonymous function is not a preferred practice in your coding.
However, a typical use case of anonymous function is callback, 
you can use a function as a callback if you do not need to repeatedly use the same function in other circumstance.

### How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)
** Check the answers one more time **
** I feel like this is a good place to also talk about programing paradigm. **
- From an OOP (Object Oriented Programming perspective), it is recommend that you group similar functions of codes together as a group, which means this can become a module, then the way to access each module is by exporting it, 
and importing it if you need to access them from another function.
- Classical inheritance is similar idea and is also a good option to consider, 
however, since in JavaScript you can also use prototype inheritance,
it is a better practice to use prototype inheritance over class so that you won't modified the original constructor.


### What's the difference between host objects and native objects?
** Research..... **

### Difference between: `function Person(){}`, `var person = Person()`, and `var person = new Person()`?
** Double Check **
- They are all ways to declare a function.
- `function Person(){}` - Function decoration
- `var person = Person()` - Function expression.
- `var person = new Person()` - Creating an object, aka instantiate.

### What's the difference between `.call` and `.apply`?
- They are both part of binding to a function/object.
- `.call` - binds a single object to another.
- `.apply`- binds an array of objects.

### Explain `Function.prototype.bind`.
- This is same as explaining what bind() is. 
- From MDN:
** The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. **
